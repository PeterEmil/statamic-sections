# Statamic Sections
by Rudy Affandi (2016)
version 1.1.0

## What is this?
This addon turns your section fieldtype into accordions or tabs. Similar to what Section Tabs was in V1.x

## Installation
Drop in the `Sections` folder into your `site/addons`

### Change UI type (none, accordion, tabs)
To use accordion styling, edit the `default.yaml` and change the value to `accordion` or `tabs`. To go back to the default v2, just put `none` in there.
